<h1>The Forgotten Spark</h1>

<h2>As Cairn gathers the Veil Fragments, each one reveals pieces of his past, slowly unraveling the mystery of how a simple stone guardian became sentient. These fragments could offer:</h2>
    <p>Flashbacks or visions of the ancient civilization that created Cairn.</p>
    <p>Encoded messages or inscriptions hidden within the Veil, left by those who experimented with magic and life itself.</p>

<h2>Theories Behind Cairn's Sentience (You could pick one, or combine elements):</h2>
    <p>Accidental Magic Surge: During the fall of the ancient civilization, a cataclysmic event triggered a surge of raw magical energy, which fused with Cairn’s stone form, giving him awareness. He wasn’t meant to be sentient, but the destruction of the Veil caused unexpected consequences.</p>
    <p>A Forgotten Soul: Cairn’s sentience is the result of a bound soul—perhaps a fallen warrior, a mage, or even the last remnant of an ancient being. The creators of Cairn infused this soul into his body as a last-ditch effort to preserve their knowledge or power, but the process was incomplete, resulting in lost memories.</p>
    <p>Veil-Infused: Cairn’s life force is tied directly to the Veil itself. As the Veil was weakened, Cairn was "awakened" to help restore it. His sentience might come from his direct link to the mystical forces of the world. As he gathers the fragments, he grows more aware of not just his surroundings, but his purpose and identity.</p>
    <p>Betrayal and Redemption: Cairn was originally designed to help maintain the Veil but was instead used as part of a betrayal that led to its shattering. The reason for his sentience could be tied to this betrayal, and his journey to restore the Veil is also one of personal redemption.</p>

<h2>Gameplay Tie-In:</h2>
    <p>Fragment Revelations: Each Veil Fragment you collect offers a memory or vision—showing how Cairn was created, and what forces led to his sentience. Some fragments could show peaceful times before the Eclipse, while others reveal the chaos and destruction.</p>
    <p>Mystical Symbols or Puzzles: As Cairn interacts with the Veil Fragments, symbols or puzzles could appear, requiring him to decipher ancient languages or unlock hidden messages, giving hints to his origin.</p>
    <p>Sentience Evolution: As the story progresses, Cairn could evolve in small ways—unlocking deeper abilities or gaining emotional depth. Perhaps at first, he’s very mechanical in his thinking, but the more Veil Fragments he collects, the more he becomes emotionally aware.</p>

<h1>Main Character: Cairn, The Stonebound Wanderer</h1>

<h2>Species:</h2>
  <p>Cairn is a stone-bound golem, forged from the very earth by an ancient and forgotten civilization. When the veil exploded, the spark of sentience that comprised the core of the veil lodged itself into Cairn and awoke his free will.</p>

<h2>Background:</h2>
  <p>Centuries ago, Cairn was created as part of a legion of stone guardians to protect the world's Veil, a mystical barrier that kept destructive forces at bay. However, a cataclysmic event caused the Veil to shatter, unleashing a corrupting force known as the Eclipse. The Eclipse turns living things into twisted, dark reflections of themselves, and even has begun to consume the world itself. Cairn, dormant for centuries, awakens with fragments of the Veil etched into his stone form, imbuing him with the power to restore it.</p>
  <p>Now, Cairn must travel through the remnants of once-glorious kingdoms, reclaiming Veil Fragments to rebuild the barrier. Along the way, he faces enemies corrupted by the Eclipse, creatures born of the stone like him, but twisted by darkness. As he ventures deeper into forgotten lands, he uncovers his role in the fall of the Veil and the true reason he was chosen to wield its power.</p>
 
<h2>Personality:</h2>
  <p>Cairn is a stoic figure, steady as the earth itself, though not devoid of emotion. He is driven by purpose, carrying the weight of his lost civilization on his shoulders. Cairn speaks little, communicating more through actions than words. As he gathers more Veil Fragments, brief memories of the world before the Eclipse surface, revealing glimpses of a past life he can barely comprehend.</p>

<h2>Primary Weapon: Veilblade</h2>
  <p>A mystical blade formed from fragments of the Veil, the Veilblade can shift between forms—extending into a longer blade for range or shortening for rapid strikes. It has a faint, ethereal glow that strengthens as Cairn restores more of the Veil.</p>

<h2>Movement:</h2>
  <p>Cairn, despite his stone form, is surprisingly agile. He can dash through crumbling ruins, leap great distances with a heavy ground-pound to break weakened floors, and use wall grips to scale cliff faces.</p>

<h2>Veil Fragments (Abilities):</h2>
  <p>As Cairn collects fragments of the Veil, he gains access to unique abilities:</p>
  <p>Stone Rebirth: Allows Cairn to temporarily harden his body, making him invulnerable to attacks and reflecting damage to enemies.</p>
  <p>Veilshift: Allows Cairn to phase through certain walls and obstacles, using his connection to the mystical Veil.</p>
  <p>Eclipse Barrage: Channeling the power of the Veil, Cairn can unleash a storm of energy shards at enemies from a distance.</p>

<h2>Veil Guardian Forms:</h2>
  <p>The Veilblade can transform into different weapons or forms as Cairn gains power, from a massive hammer that smashes through enemy defenses to a whip-like chain of light that strikes from afar.</p>

<h2>Story:</h2>
  <p>As Cairn travels the Ruined Kingdoms, he is pursued by the Heralds of Eclipse, powerful beings who seek to corrupt the remaining fragments of the Veil. Cairn must confront these beings, each tied to the once-great cities now consumed by the Eclipse, and defeat them to restore the Veil.</p>

<h2>Each Herald represents a different aspect of the lost world:</h2>
  <p>Duskforge: A once-prosperous forge city, now reduced to molten ruins, where the Flameborn Herald has merged with the Eclipse, becoming a creature of fire and molten stone.</p>
  <p>Everglade: A verdant city now overrun by twisted plant-life, where the Blight Herald manipulates the Eclipse-infused flora.</p>
  <p>Stormspire: A city built upon towering peaks, now consumed by eternal storms, where the Storm Herald commands lightning and wind, using the power of the Eclipse to rip the land apart.</p>

<h2>Themes:</h2>
  <p>The central theme revolves around identity, duty, and redemption, but mainly the concept of free will. As Cairn gathers the Veil Fragments, memories of his forgotten past reveal that he was not only created to defend the Veil but may have played a role in its shattering. Cairn is not just rebuilding the barrier to protect the world—he is seeking to right the wrongs of his past actions.</p>

<h2>Appearance:</h2>
  <p>Cairn is a hulking figure of dark, cracked stone, with veins of glowing light coursing through his form. The cracks in his body increase as he gathers more Veil Fragments, making him look increasingly fractured yet more powerful. His body is made of rough, uneven stone plates held together by a faint, mystical energy. He’s humanoid, with cracks running through his form, faintly glowing with the magic that animates him.</p>

<h2>Color Palette:</h2>
  <p>Dark, earthen tones—black, gray, and brown—complemented by the soft glow of the Veil Fragments, which emit shades of blue and purple. As the game progresses and Cairn gains more power, his more of his cracks glow.</p>

<h2>Progression & World Design:</h2>
  <p>The world is filled with underground caverns, ruined cities, and decaying temples, each tied to a specific elemental force that has been corrupted by the Eclipse. As Cairn restores the Veil, the areas once consumed by corruption slowly return to a semblance of their former glory.
